2. Fill in the required spots, such as token, prefix and change anything you like in **settings.json** and **customisation.json**.

3. To install what you need, do **npm install**<br>
(If the installation shows error for you windows users, first, blame node-gyp. Second, download integer, better-sqlite3 and quick-db from their respective repo on GitHub, extract into node_modules and cd into the folder then do node-gyp rebuild)<br>
`NOTE: Use npm install with Administrator/sudo`

4. Start the bot by having the cmd/terminal inside the bot folder and type **node .**

5. Enjoy!
